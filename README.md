This project involved building and developing the software system for a maze-solving robot. The main objective was to program the robot to map out the maze and then find the shortest path from start to end autonomously. Algorithms like the LSRB and foodfill were employed to meet the set requirements of the project. Matlab Simulink was used for ease of programming and debugging as opposed to traditional coding.
